# Floow-App-Demo-Test-framework
This framework has been built using the following tools
- Selenium Webdriver
-Appium
-Serenity BDD
-Cucumber
-Junit
-Maven

I have used Android Studio to create an Emulator . The emulator used is Android 6.0
Appium version 1.7.1 used
Java_Client 5.0.4 used

I have explicitly launched Appium server and the emulator and run the code. However this can be handled in the code.
